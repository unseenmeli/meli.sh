        <h1>Hacktoberfest with beqa!</h1>
        <h6>October 2024</h6>
        <p>
          What a wild ride this was! So me and beqa decided to participate in Hacktoberfest-- a hackathon where you
          basically code your heart out and hope for the best. We had this crazy idea and just went for it!
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole experience was absolutely insane. We're talking 10 Red Bulls, zero sleep, and pure adrenaline
          keeping us going. Our brains were basically mush by the end but we were so locked in on building this thing.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a video of what we built:</p>
        <video controls style="width: 80%; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px 0">
          <source src="../media/posts/hacktoberfest.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>
          And here's the best part-- we actually won top 20 placement! Like, out of everyone there, we made it to the
          top 20. Pretty sick, right?
        </p>
        <p>BUT (and this is a big but), we weren't even there to collect the prizes :D</p>
        <p>
          Why? Because after running on 10 Red Bulls and no sleep, we literally could not function properly anymore. Our
          brains were fried. So what did we do? We went home to sleep. Yeah, we just left and crashed. No prizes, no
          ceremony, just straight to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, it's honestly hilarious. We worked so hard, placed in the top 20, and then just... left to
          sleep. But honestly? Best decision we made. No amount of prizes is worth feeling like a complete zombie.
        </p>
        <p>Would I do it again? Absolutely. Maybe with a bit more sleep though :D</p>
        <p>
          So we used InstantDB as backend and typscript for front! The whole idea of this project was to help people
          choose places for their crazy nights! So like a Tinder but for clubs/bars/gigs and so much more! You would say
          "yeah cool idea but is that it?" the whole magic is the AI we placed in there! This AI analyzes the place and
          tells you exactly what you should be expecting when going to a certain place you choose-- so for example a
          club called Bassiani, tells you directions-- which subway station would be the closest to get there, the
          route, the vibe inside so you can wear appropriately and be ready with everything you've got before you even
          get there! Sounds cool huh? I know me and beqa are cool no need for flattering!
        </p>
        <p>So yeah! thank you for your time and as always! meli</p>
