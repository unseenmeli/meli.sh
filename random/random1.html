        <h1>Within every joke there is truth</h1>
        <p>
          Lies are like hives, no matter how they are, there's a reason they are there. In Georgia there is this saying
          (I actually do not know if there is, might just be my saying) fuck the joke if there is not a little bit of
          truth in it... sounds better in Georgian, but you get the point! Whether it is subconscious or not, we all put
          a different kind of meaning in the joke-- well not all the times but yeah-- not just making someone laugh. Or
          at least I like to think so, yet I find it beautiful... sometimes humans cannot overcome the stage of being
          forward, so we create these random paths of trying to get to the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet this word "Result" rounds everything up, doesn't it? We gave it the meaning of "Point", for example: why
          are you writing this random article/diary (or if we rephrase it), what is the point? The whole idea of meli--
          me-- is doing stuff without having a point-- of course I am not implying to do reckless stuff, but I do not
          wish to have to think why I do everything I do, you know? I do this because this is me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, back to the topic! Result that rounds everything up when it should not. I mean, of course result is
          meaningful, we need to achieve something when doing something, but how we achieve it should be the lovely part
          of it! I don't want to sit here and talk about anything I achieved without talking about how I achieved them!
          The story is the main dish, if you may!
        </p>
        <p>
          SOOOO what did this idea give you? That result is bad?-- absolutely not, because it gives us history! I HAVE
          THIS RESULT BECAUSE I DID THIS! The most meaningful thing a human can say in my opinion! I did say this, let's
          get to topic, but I never really did, so shall we?
        </p>
        <p>
          I find it amazing how people try to get around stuff (creating a path to tell what you really feel through
          lying). I MEAN ISN'T THAT AMAZING?? Expressing the most YOU kind of feeling while covering it up with the most
          NOT YOU kind of vibe? Delightful! That is why I love humanity-- a human is a social construct-- no wonder we
          are so good at it! We go through this everyday and we keep sharpening the blade we sharpened millions of
          times!
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 50px">
          Well in the end this is still some meli writing his thoughts and you can never trully know if this is true or
          not-- might be a joke! ðŸ˜¸ as for now and later on, one and only meli!
