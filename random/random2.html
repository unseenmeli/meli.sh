        <h1>Say something...</h1>
        <p>
          Have you heard of "Dead Poets Society"? I watched it fully today for the first time and let me tell you it
          was a fucking experience. This movie connects with you on a deeper level... well when it comes to me it did. I
          always was fond of philosophy and got to say Robin Williams (had to check if his last name is with 2 l's :D).
          Anyways, what actually got me to start writing this piece/thought/article, whatever you want to call it, was--
          If you have Instagram, on your own story you can leave a comment... but the difference from others' stories is
          that, on someone else's story it says: "leave a comment or @..." and on your own story it says: "say
          something...". This reminded me of this moment in Dead Poets Society, where Neil (Not the main character,
          even though I thought he was for a bit (which actually is Todd Anderson)) is trying to escape the "claws" of
          his own parents, is faced with a question, where he was to tell his true feelings to his parents; Yet Neil
          said "nothing". In this moment, I felt like if he would've stood up for himself something could've worked out.
          Yet he chose to say "Nothing" and so implemented his choice. Which, do not get me wrong, I found astonishing,
          especially when he says "I was good, I was really good"... (gave me goosebumps as I wrote this), Yet I found it
          so heart-breaking. This young man that was full of ambitions, dreams, goals was crushed by something that is
          supposed to be the closest to you... You know how they say mother teaches you love and father teaches you the
          cruelty of life? I gotta say this was shown in this movie amazingly! Exactly what happened in there. Which, to
          an extent, was wrong. Some may argue but I do not really care. Father should be strict, teach how this world
          works, yet shouldn't push as much as he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in the end... "Say something..." this phrase, I am pretty sure, has been in our heads, at some point, for a
          long time. We always get tested, lured into these scenarios where it is either you say something or you just
          go, silently, on about your life. Well at least I've been so. Till this day I cannot really stand up to my
          close people, something about denying their ideas doesn't give me a good feeling. Do not get me wrong, I can
          be the cruelest when it comes to people I do not know, but with close ones... it is really hard. It is almost
          like Neil resembled this goal, state (if you may), that I couldn't achieve... to some extent. Yet I am working
          on it! You see, saying something, doing something... means something! Sometimes you cannot quit, even when it
          is the best decision. Sometimes you are scared... sometimes this-- sometimes that... We should just get a grip
          of ourselves and do what we really feel... in this one I want to share with you guys how I want to live my
          life, which is "with no regrets."
        </p>
        <p>So if you got a thought, passion, love... how about you say something? Right now.</p>
