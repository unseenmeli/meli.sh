        <h1>SF wanderer</h1>
        <p>
          "That's a nice view," says the man on the rooftop balcony, gazing at a vista identical to a thousand others in
          this city. "It really is," he answers himself, then pauses. "But what makes this one special?" The question
          hangs in the air like fog. "Nothing, really. Just another view." His inner voice persists: "Most houses here
          have the same skyline." He nods. "Doesn't mean we can't appreciate it." A longer pause. "But this place means
          something to you, doesn't it?" The admission comes quietly: "Yeah." "Why?" He searches for words that feel
          true. "Because it's simple. Peaceful, even. Because in all this sameness, I chose this spot to be still."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Aren't you always still?" The voice cuts deeper now. "You came here for news, adventure, significant
          change—yet you're stuck in a loop." A bitter laugh escapes. "How ironic, to be a monument in a city of
          dynamism."
        </p>
        <p>
          And you? You're just a dynamic soul stuck in a monument. Two prisoners sharing one body—one craving stillness,
          one screaming for motion. ...This rooftop isn't peaceful anymore; it's a battlefield where every breath is
          contested territory. The city below pulses with indifferent life while up here, the war rages: stay or leap,
          observe or become, monument or meteor. The view doesn't matter. What matters is this pressure building in the
          chest, this choice that demands to be made...
        </p>

          "That's a nice view," says the man, putting out his cigarette. The ember dies against cold concrete. The
          stairwell swallows him whole, and the city continues without him. Somewhere a door closes and another life
          begins. Somewhere else, someone arrives in San Francisco with dreams. The rooftop remains, waiting for
          tomorrow's visit, for the same view, the same questions, the same careful extinguishing... of the spark.
